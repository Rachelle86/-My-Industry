    <p>Here is a quote from <abbr title="International Rescue Committee">IRC</abbr></p>

            Regions in East Africa are experiencing one of the worst droughts in recent decades, triggered by six
            consecutive failed rainy seasons. An estimated 40 million people are affected across Ethiopia, Kenya and
            Somalia, and in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance.

            The IRC helps families from East Africa by providing essential services such as water, health care,
            nutritious meals and cash assistance to those impacted by the drought. But we can only continue this vital
            work with your support.
